    </div>

    <div id="data_receive">
      <h3>Data We Receive from Others</h3>
      <div class="headerline"></div>
      <p>
        We may receive information about you from other sources as required in connection with our legitimate interests, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data (including marketing data).
        <br><br>
        We also may receive data that was initially collected (over time and across websites, mobile apps, and mobile devices) by our data partners (such as mobile app publishers and developers, advertising networks, advertising exchanges, mobile measurement platforms, supply side platforms and other websites and services), which may include:
      </p>
      <h4>Ad Data</h4>
      <p>
        We receive advertisement requests (to display an advertisement on mobile app or device, and a website) along with its associated data, such as a device identifier, the IDFA and AAID, or another similar identifier, the browser or device type, IP address, app publisher, operating system, location, and other similar device-specific information.
        <br><br>
        We use your IDFA or Advertising ID, information about any Client app you download and supplemental information associated with your device IDFA (e.g., the apps you download and any publisher-provided data) to provide best ads experience to you on behalf of our clients.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="collection_usage">
      <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
      <div class="headerline"></div>
      <p>
        We associate the data and information that we collect with the data and information we receive from others. Our technology contextualizes and aggregates this data. The location intelligence we derive (and infer) from the data and the information we amass is the basis of the services we provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For marketing and advertising purposes (such as to display and optimize advertisements, to create audience segments, and to provide measurement and reporting services),</li>
        <li>For capturing and understanding the interests, activities, and trends of consumers (online and in the real world),<br>for data analytics and data services (such as for marketing and advertising, trend analysis, or market research), and<br>for providing, maintaining, and improving the products and services we offer (and to develop new products and services).</li>
      </ul>
       <h4>Note about personally identifiable information</h4>
       <p>
        In some cases, we receive information that can identify a specific person (like a name and address). We use this type of information for statistical, analytical, and logistical purposes and for improving the products and services we offer. We do not use this type of information for targeting advertisements (other than at an aggregated level, such as zip code), although we do use personally identifiable information to help synchronize our data sets with our customers’ or our partners’ data sets (to find matches through a common identifier).
        <br><br>
        We do not display or target advertisements based on information or an activity that is deemed to be “sensitive” (based on local laws or applicable industry standards).
        <br><br>
        We may use (and store) the data and information we collect and receive on servers that may be located outside the country where you live.
      </p>
      <h4>Automated decision making</h4>
      <p>
        We perform the following automated decision making processes using your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users.<br>Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer.</li>
        <li>To power predictive machine learning features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future</li>
        <li>To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="information_share">
      <h3>Information We Share with Others</h3>
      <div class="headerline"></div>
      <p>
        We share the data and information we compile about someone in an aggregated or anonymized way using advertising IDs or another type of anonymous identifier:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To display and optimize advertisements (like improving the relevancy of the advertisements displayed, tailoring them to certain interests, or creating audience segments),</li>
        <li>For measurement, statistics, usage reporting, and other data analytics, and</li>
        <li>For industry analysis, demographic profiling, market research and other such purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In certain cases, we share personally identifiable information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When a person has given their consent to do so (like where you are notified that the information you submit will be with service providers who help us provide our services (if it is necessary, but they are not permitted to disclose or use that information for any other purpose),</li>
        <li>We may provide the collected information to our subsidiaries, third party partners and agents to improve advertisement targeting, make and create offers, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our systems and products.  They are not permitted to disclose or use that information for any other purpose,</li>
        <li>When we believe that we are legally authorized or required to do so, or where doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or to respond to lawful requests or legal authorities (such as a subpoena or court order),</li>
        <li>If it is necessary to defend or to protect our rights, property, or interests, and in connection with a corporate<br>transaction (like a financing, acquisition, sale of company assets, or bankruptcy) where this information would be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will try to honor the opt-out signals for personalized advertising that are provided directly to us or that we receive from our data partners.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="your_rights">
      <h3>Your Rights</h3>
      <div class="headerline"></div>
      <h4>Opting Out of Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        In line with best practice in our industry, we respect End User’s rights to opt-out of receiving Interest Based Advertising.
      </p>
      <h4>Personalized Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        If you want to limit or stop receiving targeted ads, there are several choice mechanisms available:
      </p>
      <h4>On Mobile Devices</h4>
      <p>
        You may limit ad tracking in mobile app environments on your device. For the most effective and up-to-date methods for doing so, you should consult instructions provided by those device manufacturers. We offer the following information solely for informational purposes, and we cannot guarantee that the methods below are the most current:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">
            <u>Apple instructions for how to Limit Ad Tracking on devices such as iPhones and iPads</u>
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">
            <u>Google instructions for how to express choice on Android devices</u>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where possible when MOLOCO receives a request to limit ad tracking, we will collect and store information from your device only as needed to honor your choice and for limited research and development purposes to improve our device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honor your choice.
      </p>
      <h4>Other Options and Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        You can opt-out for web browsers, mobile apps, and mobile devices.  Some mobile devices may not support the use of cookies.  If you clear your cookies from your browser, or use a different browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.  These opt-out choices only stop you from receiving tailored ads from the selected source.  Even after opting out, you will continue to receive generic ads and you may continue to receive tailored ads from other advertisers and services (if you have not opted out from their services explicitly).  We do not link web browsers and mobile devices, however, in some cases, we may partner with a company that does cross-device linking for personalized advertising purposes (in which case you would need to perform an opt-out for each browser and mobile device you don’t want linked and/or used for these purposes).
      </p>
      <h4>Location Settings</h4>
      <p>
        If you want to limit or prevent location data from your device from being collected, you can adjust this capability through your mobile device settings.  See instructions on how to manage your location settings for your Apple and Android devices.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Data Subject Rights</h4>
      <p>
        You have basic rights under privacy and data protection laws related to the data we process about you. You do not have to pay a fee, and we will aim to respond to your request within 30 days. We will try to honor the requests you make related to your rights as the law allows, which means in some cases there may be legal or other reasons that we may not be able to address the specific request you make related to your rights. You have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to ask us to provide you (or another data controller) with copies of the personal information that we hold about you at any time.</li>
        <li>The right to ask us to update or correct any out-of-date or incorrect personal information that we hold about you<br>(in accordance with applicable data protection laws);</li>
        <li>The right to ask us not to process your personal information for the legitimate interests that we have set out above.<br>In certain circumstances we may not be able to stop using your personal information but, if that is the case, we will let you know and tell you why; and</li>
        <li>The right to opt out of any marketing communications that we (or any third party to whom we have disclosed your personal information with your consent) may send you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please write to us, either by post or by e-mail at <a href="mailto: privacy@molocoads.com"><u>privacy@molocoads.com</u></a> and we will respond within 30 days.
